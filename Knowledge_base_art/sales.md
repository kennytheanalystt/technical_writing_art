In the fast-paced and competitive landscape of business, data-driven decision-making has become a cornerstone for achieving success. Among the plethora of analytical techniques, sales analysis stands as a crucial pillar that empowers organizations to gain valuable insights into their sales performance and customer behavior. Within the realm of sales analysis, two powerful tools emerge as beacons of understanding – RFM analysis and KPI reports.
<br>
At its core, sales analysis involves the systematic examination of sales data to extract meaningful information about a company's sales performance, customer interactions, and market trends. Armed with these invaluable insights, businesses can make well-informed decisions, optimize strategies, and strengthen their competitive edge in the market.
<br>
The analytics proccess involves the systematic review of sales-related information, such as revenue, units sold, customer demographics, product performance, and other relevant metrics.

The main objectives of sales analysis are to:

- Evaluate Performance.
- Identify Trends and Pattern.
- Understand Customer Behavior.
- Optimize Inventory Management.
- Assess Marketing Effectiveness.
- Forecast Future Sales.

<br>

Sales analysis is an essential aspect of business intelligence, as it empowers companies to make informed decisions, spot opportunities for growth, and identify areas for improvement in their sales processes. It plays a vital role in driving sales strategies, increasing revenue, and overall business success.

<br>

RFM Analysis: One of the fundamental methodologies within sales analysis is the RFM analysis, an acronym for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that provides a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior based on their transaction history.

<br>

KPI Reports: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) play a vital role in comprehending the overall effectiveness and success of a company's sales operations. KPIs are quantifiable metrics that serve as benchmarks, providing businesses with specific targets to monitor and analyze.

PREREQUISITE: Any SQL Tool and Tableau

<br>

### LOADING THE DATA SET

At first we need to load the dataset we are going to work with. There are several ways to load/import data set into an SQl database, for this guide i am going to use python to import the data set into PostgreSQL.

> Note: The data set use in this notebook is sourced from [kaggle](kaggle.com) > <br>

### To import data set into SQL using python;

<p>The to_sql() function in Python is used to write records from a Pandas DataFrame to a SQL database. It is a very powerful function that can be used to store data in a variety of database formats.  <br>
The syntax for the to_sql() function is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
sales_df = pd.read_csv('Superstore data.csv', encoding='ISO 8859-1')
```

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('postgresql://postgres:mlyt09@localhost:5432/projectsql')
```

> Here: `postgresql://` > the sql_tool, `postgres:` > the user, ~~`mlyt09`~~ > the password, `@localhost:` > the host, `5432` > the port, `/projectsql` the database.

```python
player_df.to_sql(name='sales', con=engine,index=False if_exists='replace')
```

Check to confirm the data is in PSQL...

```sql
projectsql=# \dt sales
```

List of relations
| Schema | Name | Type | Owner |
-------- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| public | sales | table | postgres |

```

```sql
ALTER TABLE sales ADD year INT
```

ALTER TABLE

```sql
ALTER TABLE sales ADD month INT
```

ALTER TABLE

```sql
UPDATE sales SET year = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)

### (Qr9) what was the best month for sales in a specific year ?

### what's the sales for the month?

In sales analysis, determining the best month in a specific year for sales involves identifying the month with the highest sales revenue or volume. It provides valuable insights into peak periods of customer demand and sales performance. This analysis helps businesses optimize their resources, plan promotions, and capitalize on favorable market conditions.

In addition to finding the best month, it's also essential to assess the sales performance in that month compared to the previous year or previous months of the same year. This year-over-year or month-over-month analysis can provide a deeper understanding of growth patterns and identify areas for improvement.

-->

### (Qr12) RFM Analysis.

RFM analysis is a valuable marketing technique used to analyze customer behavior and segment customers based on their purchasing patterns. The acronym "RFM" stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, which are the three key metrics used in this analysis.

1. Recency (R): This metric measures how recently a customer made a purchase. It indicates the time elapsed since the last transaction, and customers who made recent purchases are considered more engaged and potentially more valuable.

2. Frequency (F): This metric refers to the number of times a customer made a purchase within a specific timeframe. Customers who make frequent purchases are usually loyal and valuable to the business.

3. Monetary Value (M): This metric represents the total monetary value of a customer's purchases within a particular period. Customers with higher monetary spending are typically more valuable to the business.

By combining these three metrics, RFM analysis categorizes customers into various segments, such as high-value, medium-value, and low-value customers. This segmentation allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, personalized offers, and customer retention efforts to target each customer segment more effectively.

RFM analysis is commonly used in e-commerce, retail, and various other industries to identify their most valuable customers, understand customer behavior, and improve overall marketing efforts and sales performance.

<!-- -- ranking the recency, frequency, and monetary from high to low -->

### (Qr14) Ranking the Recency, Frequency and monetary value.

In sales analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) segmentation, customers are ranked from 4 to 1 based on their RFM scores. RFM analysis categorizes customers into different segments to better understand their behavior and value. The RFM scores for each customer are calculated based on three metrics: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. Here's how the ranking works:

1. RFM Score 4: This represents the highest score and indicates the most valuable customers. Customers with an RFM score of 4 in all three categories (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value) are those who have made recent purchases, frequent transactions, and high-value spending. These customers are considered top-tier and represent a significant portion of a company's revenue.

2. RFM Score 3: Customers with an RFM score of 3 in any two of the three categories are ranked as the second-highest group. This group includes customers who have either made recent and frequent purchases, frequent and high-value transactions, or recent and high-value spending. While they may not be as valuable as RFM 4 customers, they still contribute significantly to a company's success.

3. RFM Score 2: Customers with an RFM score of 2 in two categories and any score in the third category fall into this group. For example, a customer may have made frequent purchases but not recently, or they may have made recent purchases but with a lower monetary value. This group represents average customers who could potentially be nurtured and encouraged to move up to higher RFM segments.

4. RFM Score 1: This represents the lowest score, indicating the least valuable customers. Customers with an RFM score of 1 in all three categories (i.e., low recency, low frequency, and low monetary value) are the least engaged and contribute the least to a company's revenue. These customers may require more attention and targeted marketing efforts to increase their engagement and loyalty.

By ranking customers based on their RFM scores, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and customer retention efforts more effectively. Targeted marketing campaigns can be directed at high RFM customers to encourage repeat purchases and build loyalty, while special promotions can be offered to low RFM customers to entice them to increase their engagement and spending. Understanding customer behavior through RFM analysis helps businesses optimize their sales and marketing efforts to drive revenue and overall business success.

### (Qr18) what two or more item are often sold together.

In sales analysis, the concept of "two or more products often sold together" refers to products that are frequently purchased in combination by customers. This purchasing behavior is known as product bundling or cross-selling. When customers tend to buy multiple items as a package or in conjunction with each other, it creates opportunities for businesses to capitalize on this trend and optimize their sales strategies.

Identifying which products are often sold together is crucial for several reasons:

1. Cross-Selling Opportunities: Knowing which products are frequently purchased together allows businesses to cross-sell complementary items. By suggesting related or additional products during the purchase process, companies can increase the average transaction value and boost revenue.

2. Targeted Marketing: Understanding product combinations that resonate with customers enables targeted marketing campaigns. Companies can tailor promotions, discounts, or product bundles based on customers' buying patterns to drive sales.

3. Inventory Management: Recognizing products that are often sold together helps businesses manage their inventory effectively. Maintaining sufficient stock of popular product combinations ensures that customers can easily purchase these items without experiencing stockouts.

4. Customer Satisfaction: Offering product bundles that align with customers' preferences enhances their overall shopping experience and satisfaction. Satisfied customers are more likely to return for future purchases, fostering brand loyalty.

To identify products often sold together, sales analysis involves examining transaction data, customer purchase history, and item associations. By analyzing large datasets, businesses can uncover patterns and relationships between different products, which can then inform sales strategies, marketing efforts, and inventory management decisions.

For example, a retail store may find that customers who purchase smartphones frequently buy phone cases and screen protectors as well. Armed with this knowledge, the store can bundle these items together, offer a discount on the package, and prominently display them as a recommended combination, encouraging customers to make additional purchases.

By leveraging insights from product bundling or cross-selling, businesses can optimize their sales tactics, enhance customer experience, and drive revenue growth. It allows companies to better meet customer needs, increase sales opportunities, and remain competitive in the market.

### Visualization (KPI Report)

KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator. It is a quantifiable metric used to evaluate the success or performance of an organization, project, or individual in achieving specific objectives. KPIs are essential in measuring progress toward goals and providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of strategies and processes.

<br>

KPIs can vary depending on the industry, department, or goals of the organization. For example, in sales, KPIs may include metrics like revenue, conversion rate, or customer acquisition cost. In customer service, KPIs could involve response time, customer satisfaction ratings, or issue resolution time.

<br>

The selection of KPIs is crucial because they act as benchmarks that help organizations make data-driven decisions. KPIs provide a clear understanding of performance trends and can highlight areas that require improvement. By regularly tracking and analyzing KPIs, businesses can identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities to optimize their operations and achieve greater success.
